<h1> Matchbox Car Replica Reflection </h1>
<p> by Evie Scinto </p>
<p> This project in E+D I was to create a 3D model of a matchbox car, and print it using a 3D printer. In this project, we focused on creating an accurately scaled model of the toy car. Additionally, we explored using CAD (computer-aided drafting) to define and extrude shapes in order to print our car and to further understand  the X, Y, and Z planes in a 3D form. </p>


<h2> Guidelines: </h2>
<ol>
<li>Car designed as an intersection of three forms</li>
<li>Design car in a 1:1 ratio</li>
<li>Size accuracy ±1% </li>
<li>Design is exported as stl </li>
<li>Student orients model in Cura for 3D printing to minimize support material</li>
<li>File is exported as a gcode to be read by the 3D printer</li>
<li>Final design is shared out as an embedded STL on an HTML webpage </li>
</ol>

<h2> Process: </h2>
<p>My first step in this project was to begin the design process by creating an engineering drawing. Once I had selected a matchbox car to replicate in OnshapeI began my engineering drawing. I used calipers to get accurate measurements and drew 3 different 2D views of my car, and then drew a final 3D sketch. Next, I scanned and uploaded the drawing to github and used the screenshots in Onshape to be used in the 3D modeling process.</p>

<p> For the next step in the process, I needed to scale and render my selected matchbox car digitally. I started by drawing a profile on each plane using my engineering drawing. This helped me map out the end points of my car on my 3D extruded box. After completing this step, I used the extrusion tools in order to remove negative spaces in the 3D box. This created an accurate shape of my car.  Finally I used the extrusion and fillet tools to make my car look smoother and add wheels to its shape.</p>

<p>The next step was to import my design into Cura by turning my Onshape into an stl file. Once in Cura, I positioned my 3D model so I could use the smallest amount of support material, and also set my parameters to 0.6mm nozzle. Lastly, I edited my other setting to prepare to print. Then I was able to export the file into GCODE and uploaded it to an SD card which allowed me to print. </p>

<p> The Final step was to document my process through github, and analyze how similar my dimensions were on my car by making a CAD drawing. I was able to find how close I was to my goal of making an accurate model of my car.</p>

<h2> Setbacks and Solutions: </h2>
<p> A setback I encountered was when I was drawing one of the faces of my car on my original box extrusion. I wasn’t able to get my drawing to be as proportional as I wanted it to. After trying to redraw my face I realized that I had placed an unwanted restriction on my drawing tool by making one of the sides coincident After I deleted the restriction, I was able to create the drawing the way I wanted to.  </p>

<p> Another setback I encountered was once I finally printed my car, I realized one of the sides wasn’t as proportional as I would have liked. I think this is because my car wasn’t perfectly to scale in my engineering drawing. Since this was so early in my process, I wasn’t able to correct the size for my final car. But if I were to complete this project again, my solution to this problem would be to keep editing my engineering drawing until it fits perfectly within the dimensions of my 3D extrusion box.
